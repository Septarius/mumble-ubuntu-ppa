This package includes a system-wide installation of murmurd. If you want a
personal server running on your own user account, use the murmur-user-wrapper
script.

If you have apache running, you can install the mumble-server-web package to
get web-accessible scripts.

Murmur's root user is called SuperUser. To set the password for superuser,
simply dpkg-reconfigure mumble-server.
