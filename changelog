mumble (1.2.3-349-g315b5f5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop the hard dep on boost-1.46, that's been removed now.  Closes: #678759
    Drop the | dep on alternative boost, since that's what got this package
    overlooked when people were removing boost-1.46.

  * Drop the | dep on libgl-dev, that's been gone a long time now too and
    leaves us vulnerable to a similar problem.

  * Drop the mumble-server-web package altogether.  Upstream reports that it
    is unmaintained and "pretty useless anyway", which seems to be well backed
    up by the fact that a call to Ice_intversion() was added in March 2010,
    and that function has never existed in any version of zeroc-ice ever.
    A function named Ice_intVersion was added to -ice 3.2.1 though ...
    Since it's taken this long for anyone to notice, we can be pretty sure that
    there aren't any actual users of it.  Closes: #676815, #676816

  * Build-Depend on the unfycked version of zeroc-ice, so the ABI broken one
    doesn't accidentally get used by an out of date buildd.  Closes: #675955
    Force building with gcc-4.6, since that's required for zeroc-ice deps now,
    until they get their act together and write some actually legal code.

  * Cherry-pick the upstream patches to fix the "audio glitches", and provide
    codec thresholds and warnings.  Closes: #675971 since it fixes the only
    actual bug reported there.

  * Drop the watch file, since this has been building snapshots from git now
    since 1.2.3-3 (and before).

    Thanks lintian.

    dependency on glibc-private with glibc >= 2.8, because mumble uses private
    symbols of glibc for the overlay feature.
