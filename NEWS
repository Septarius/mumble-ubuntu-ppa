mumble (1.2.0~200910141302-8af721-1) experimental; urgency=low

    The 1.2.0 series uses a new protocol, which makes it incompatible with 1.1.8
    and earlier version. If you wish to connect to an older server, there is a
    separate mumble-11x package with a backward compatible client (mumble11x).
    There is no backward-compatible server, so if you upgrade the server connecting
    clients must be running 1.2.0 or newer.
