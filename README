Mumble Ubuntu PPA template package
==================================

This git repository contains a template Debian package that we use to
generate the Mumble PPAs that live on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~mumble

General Idea
============

The idea of this package is to be a base from which packages for various
Ubuntu PPA builds can be built from.

All the entries made by the Mumble team in the changelog are made for
a special release called 'template'. For example, the latest release
as of this writing is 1.2.4~rc1-8-gb115a29-0~template1 and the whole
changelog entry is:

    mumble (1.2.4~rc1-8-gb115a29-0~template1) template; urgency=low

      * Drop version requirement on libzeroc-ice-dev to build on precise.
      * Use bundled CELT codecs to build on raring.
      * Add CONFIG+=bundled-opus to force the use of the bundled Opus library.

All modifications made in the base template should target the template release
and use the debian version '0~template1' (and bump if appropriate).

Every time the Mumble team updates the template package, one of these template
entries will be added. The package version number that is used is simply a
reflection of the current Mumble package at the time of the update.

When building a source package for upload to Launchpad, the ppagen.bash script
(which also lives in this repository) can be used. For example, to generate
a package using the template, use:

 ./ppagen.bash 1.2.4~rc1-8-gb115a29 quantal 1 --dry-run  # drop --dry run to upload

and without dry run, uploaded to the mumble-snapshot PPA
(which lives at https://launchpad.net/~mumble/+archive/snapshot):

 ./ppagen.bash 1.2.4~rc1-8-gb115a29 quantal 1 --snapshot  # use --release to upload
                                                          # to the mumble-release PPA

The ppagen.bash script will, when running the above command:

 * Download the Mumble tarball for the given version (and a GPG .sig)
 * Verify the signature
 * Clone the mumble-ubuntu-ppa repository into the 'debian' folder
   in the root of the source tree.
 * Add a new changelog entry for the PPA build.
 * Upload it to the mumble-snapshot PPA (https://launchpad.net/~mumble/+archive/snapshot)

The changelog entry that the script adds will be of the form:

    mumble (1.2.4~rc1-8-gb115a29-1~ppa1~quantal1) quantal; urgency=low

      * PPA Upload of 1.2.4~rc1-8-gb115a29 snapshot for Ubuntu quantal

     -- Mikkel Krautz <mikkel@krautz.dk>   Sun, 03 Feb 2013 15:19:02 +0100

with the latest template changelog entry exactly below it:

    mumble (1.2.4~rc1-8-gb115a29-0~template1) template; urgency=low

      * Drop version requirement on libzeroc-ice-dev to build on precise.
      * Use bundled CELT codecs to build on raring.
      * Add CONFIG+=bundled-opus to force the use of the bundled Opus library.

     -- Mikkel Krautz <mikkel@krautz.dk>  Sat, 03 Feb 2013 14:39:40 +0100

That is, the changelog entry that is added by the ppagen.bash script is merely
a temporary indicator of the fact that a PPA build was performed (oh, and it of
course also provides the version number to use for the package and the release
to target).
