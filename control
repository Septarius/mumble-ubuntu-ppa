Description: Low latency VoIP client
 Mumble is a low-latency, high quality voice chat program for gaming. It
 features noise suppression, automatic gain control and low latency audio
 with support for multiple audio standards. Mumble includes an in-game
 overlay compatible with most open-source and commercial 3D applications.
 Mumble is just a client and uses a non-standard protocol. You will need
 a dedicated server to talk to other users. Server functionality is
 provided by the package "mumble-server".

Description: Low latency VoIP server
 Murmur is the VoIP server component for Mumble. Murmur is installed
 in a system-wide fashion, but can also be run by individual users.
 Each murmur process supports multiple virtual servers, each with their
 own user base and channel list. Administration of murmur is done through
 D-Bus. Example scripts which register new users and list connected users
 through a web page are can be found in the package 'mumble-server-web'.
